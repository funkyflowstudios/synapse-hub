# Synapse Hub Development Progress

## Project Setup - Initial Assessment

**Date:** May 29, 2025  
**Status:** Project Initialization

### Current State
- Empty project directory at `/Users/santeri/synapse-hub`
- No existing codebase or configuration files
- Design document `@docs Synapse_Hub_UI_Design` not found in current workspace

### Next Steps Required
1. Clarify project requirements and scope
2. Obtain or create design specifications
3. Choose technology stack (React/Next.js, Vue, Angular, etc.)
4. Initialize project structure
5. Set up development environment and tooling

### Questions for Clarification
- What type of application is Synapse Hub? (Web app, desktop app, mobile app?)
- What are the core features and functionality requirements?
- Are there any specific technology constraints or preferences?
- Is there an existing design document or wireframes available?

### Decisions Made
- Using Agent Mode approach as requested
- Will maintain atomic commits and progress tracking
- Plan to implement modular, testable components
- Will create `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files as patterns emerge
