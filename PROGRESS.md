## Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundational Rules âœ…

**Date:** May 29, 2025  
**Status:** Completed

### Framework Selection: SvelteKit
**Justification based on @docs Synapse_Hub_UI_Design requirements:**
- **Performance**: Svelte's compile-time optimization aligns perfectly with sub-100ms shell load requirements
- **Dynamic UI**: Excellent reactive system for liquid crystal controls and generative materiality  
- **Micro-frontend support**: SvelteKit's island architecture supports independently updatable components
- **WebAssembly integration**: Strong WASM support for GPU-accelerated transitions and shader-based effects
- **Bundle size**: Minimal runtime overhead crucial for performance budgets (sub-50ms LoAF)

### Completed Tasks
- âœ… SvelteKit project initialized with TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint
- âœ… Additional tools configured: Vitest, Playwright, TailwindCSS, Storybook, Drizzle ORM
- âœ… Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore
- âœ… Project structure created: `src/components`, `src/lib`, `src/styles`, `src/routes`, `src/workers`
- âœ… .cursor/rules created:
  - `core-dev-standards.mdc` - Code quality, version control, basic accessibility
  - `performance-guidelines.mdc` - LoAF targets, GPU acceleration, Web Workers
  - `accessibility.mdc` - WCAG 2.2+ AAA compliance, motion preferences, screen reader support
- âœ… Code quality verification: All linting rules pass, Prettier formatting applied
- âœ… Testing infrastructure verified: 10 unit tests + 1 e2e test passing
- âœ… Development environment confirmed: Dev server, Storybook, and all tooling operational

### Architecture Foundation
- **Performance Budget**: Target sub-100ms interactive shell load, sub-50ms LoAF
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2+ AAA compliance with high-contrast modes
- **Visual System**: Prepared for liquid crystal controls, generative materiality, spatial audio
- **Technology Stack**: SvelteKit + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Vitest + Storybook
- **Quality Assurance**: ESLint + Prettier + Vitest + Playwright + Storybook testing

### Next Phase Prerequisites
- Begin implementing core layout structure (three-panel adaptive layout)
- Create design tokens and theme system for hyper-personalized adaptive theming
- Set up performance monitoring and testing infrastructure

## Phase 1: Core Layout & Design System (Next)
**Objective**: Implement the three-panel adaptive layout and establish design tokens for the hyper-personalized theming system.
