# Accessibility Standards

## WCAG Compliance
- Commit to WCAG 2.2+ AAA where possible (@docs Synapse_Hub_UI_Design (source 86)).
- Maintain color contrast ratios of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
- Provide alternative text for all images and visual content.

## Motion & Visual Preferences
- All visual features (generative materials, liquid controls) must have high-contrast modes and respect prefers-reduced-motion (@docs Synapse_Hub_UI_Design (source 87)). Design placeholders for these modes.
- Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for all animations.
- Provide static alternatives for dynamic visual effects.

## Navigation & Interaction
- Ensure clear, readable typography and intuitive navigation (@docs Synapse_Hub_UI_Design (source 88)).
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible with visible focus indicators.
- Implement proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) for screen readers.
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.) instead of generic divs.

## Screen Reader Support
- Provide meaningful ARIA labels and descriptions for complex UI components.
- Use ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates.
- Ensure form elements have proper labels and error messages.

## Testing Requirements
- Test with keyboard navigation only.
- Verify compatibility with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).
- Validate color contrast in both light and dark themes.
