# Performance Guidelines

## Animation & Rendering
- Strive for sub-50ms Long Animation Frames (LoAF) as per @docs Synapse_Hub_UI_Design (source 6).
- Implement GPU-accelerated transitions and effects by default using CSS transforms and opacity, or WebGL where appropriate (@docs Synapse_Hub_UI_Design (source 8)).
- All animations should use `transform` and `opacity` properties when possible to maintain 60fps.

## Background Processing
- Utilize Web Workers extensively for non-UI critical tasks (@docs Synapse_Hub_UI_Design (source 9)).
- Offload data processing, API calls, and complex calculations to Web Workers.
- Keep the main thread focused on UI interactions and rendering.

## Resource Loading
- Employ proactive resource loading for critical path assets only, based on predictive AI if feasible (as per @docs Synapse_Hub_UI_Design (source 7)). Initially, focus on identifying critical assets.
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components.
- Use optimized image formats (WebP, AVIF) and responsive images.

## Bundle Optimization
- Target sub-100ms interactive shell load time.
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size through tree-shaking and code splitting.
- Use dynamic imports for route-based code splitting.
