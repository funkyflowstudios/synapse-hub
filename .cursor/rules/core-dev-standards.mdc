# Core Development Standards

## Code Quality
- All JavaScript/TypeScript code must adhere to modern ESNext standards.
- Use Prettier for code formatting (configure a .prettierrc file with sensible defaults like single quotes, trailing commas).
- Use ESLint for code linting (configure a basic ESLint setup for the chosen framework).
- All components should be modular and well-documented with JSDoc or TSDoc comments.

## Version Control
- Commit messages should follow conventional commit guidelines.
- Before committing, ensure all linters and formatters pass, and all tests are green.

## Accessibility
- Prioritize semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility as per @docs Synapse_Hub_UI_Design (source 88).
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible.
- Maintain proper focus management and color contrast ratios.
